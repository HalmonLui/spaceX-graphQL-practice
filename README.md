# spaceX-graphQL-practice
Practicing GraphQL, Apollo, and React.js using SpaceX's public API

https://spacex-missions.herokuapp.com/ (May take a minute to load due to Heroku's auto session timeout)

# Why
I wanted to learn how to use GraphQL and Apollo with React.js. 

# How
To fetch the API information, I used Axios instead of Fetch this time to practice another way of API calling.
SpaceX's API: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2025350/RWaEzAiG
The data from the API was saved as a JSON and accessible through graphQL. 
Afterwards, this data was mapped to bootstrap styled components through React.js
